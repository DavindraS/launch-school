Practice Problem 8

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.take(2)

My Answer:
I did not know what take does, so I looked it up in the docs under Array.take.
It says that it returns the first n elements, in this case the first 2 elements
  or [1, 2].

The docs don't say whether it is destructive or not, so to make sure, I just
tried it out in irb.
